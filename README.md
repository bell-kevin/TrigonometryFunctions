# TrigonometryFunctions
Trigonometry Functions.  Create an application that prompts the user for an angle in degrees, then displays the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle. It’s important to notice that the API heading for the sine, cosine, and tangent functions require radians, not degrees, for the parameter. Be sure to convert the input degrees to radians first, then calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent.  Ask for input and read it into the program as a string. Use wrapper classes to convert that string to the appropriate numeric value. Do NOT use “nextInt()” or “nextDouble()” Scanner methods.  You must format the output using the “printf” method learned in this chapter. Notice in the sample session that the colons align on the right – do not align the words on the left. The answers must have 4 decimal places. Be sure the “Build Successful” message is on a separate line below the execution of the program. Use the “\n” escape character as needed. You may not print a blank line, as in “Sysem.out.println(“”);” – every print statement must have content to print.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
